# Before starting please follow the next few steps (files content can be anything and will be shown to you by the test):
# - Download the cgi_test executable on the host
# - Create a directory YoupiBanane with:
#         -a file name youpi.bad_extension
#         -a file name youpi.bla
#         -a sub directory called nop
#                 -a file name youpi.bad_extension in nop
#                 -a file name other.pouic in nop
#         -a sub directory called Yeah
#                 -a file name not_happy.bad_extension in Yeah
# press enter to continue

# Setup the configuration file as follow:
# - / must answer to GET request ONLY
# - /put_test/* must answer to PUT request and save files to a directory of your choice
# - any file with .bla as extension must answer to POST request by calling the cgi_test executable
# - /post_body must answer anything to POST request with a maxBody of 100
# - /directory/ must answer to GET request and the root of it would be the repository YoupiBanane and if no file are requested, it should search for youpi.bad_extension files
